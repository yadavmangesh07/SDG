# Biofuel Website


Biofuel Website is a platform aimed at promoting sustainable development goals by collecting plastics and converting them into biofuel through catalytic conversion. This project utilizes Vite, React, Node.js, and MongoDB to create a dynamic and interactive website for users interested in contributing to the cause of sustainable energy production.
